A basic version of the game Rock/Paper/Scissors that allows the user to play against a "random" computer counterpart.

v1 - Console app with prompts for user input
v2 - Move everything player sees/uses from console to DOM

8-20 - v2 is at minimum viable level.

This is an exercise for the Odin Project.

// 2. remove logic that ends play at five rounds
// 3. create three buttons, on for each selection
	// a. add event listener to the button that calls playround function with the correct player

// 5. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once the play reaches 5 points
